Git v2.17.1 Release Notes
=========================

Fixes since v2.17
-----------------

 * Submodule "names" come from the untrusted .gitmodules file, but
   we blindly append them to $GIT_DIR/modules to create our on-disk
   repo paths. This means you can do bad things by putting "../"
   into the name (among other things).  As these are initially taken
   from the path the submodule initially bound to the project and
   then serve as a constant name across moving it in the directory
   structure, a submodule with a name that does not pass
   verify_path() check, which rejects a string with a substring
   "/../" and ".git/" etc., is now ignored.

 * In addition to the above fix that also appears in maintenance
   releases v2.13.7, v2.14.4, v2.15.2 and v2.16.4, this has support on
   the server side to reject pushes to repositories that attempt to
   create such problematic .gitmodules file etc. as tracked contents,
   to help hosting sites protect their customers by preventing
   malicious contents from spreading.

Credit for finding this vulnerability and the proof of concept from
which the test script was adapted goes to Etienne Stalmans.  Credit
for the fix goes to Jeff King, Johannes Schindelin and others.
